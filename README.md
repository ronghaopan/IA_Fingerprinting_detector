# IA_Fingerprinting_detector
Fingerprinting Detector IA is a tool based on OpenWPM and artificial intelligence that allows the detection of fingerprint extraction techniques or active fingerprinting. It analyses a database of one million websites published by Pricenton University and has created three detection models with a precession of around 96%. 
## Requirements
### Operating System
Ubuntu version higher than 18.04 is recommended
### Dependencies
- OpenWPM (https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM). To install OpenWPM, I ran the install.sh script. If you want to develop the extension that OpenWPM uses to instrument or run tests specific to this tool, use the install-dev.sh script.
- Anaconda (Recommended) (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Includes the Pandas and Jupyter Notebook packages.
- The application notebook is designed to run inside the same folder where OpenWPM is located.
